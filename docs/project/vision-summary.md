## Three Modes, One Platform

| Mode | Purpose | Key Features | Use Case |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Entity Proposal** | Test new entity types | Define â†’ Simulate â†’ Verify â†’ Propose | Teams proposing MESSAGE_QUEUE_* entities |
| **Existing Entity** | Build on current entities | Import â†’ Query â†’ Build â†’ Verify | Teams using synthesized entities |
| **Hybrid** | Combine new & existing | Mix entities â†’ Test relationships â†’ Unified dashboards | End-to-end observability |

## Verification Layers

1. **NRDB Verification** âœ“
   - Entity synthesis confirmed
   - Data freshness validated
   - Relationships established

2. **NRQL Verification** âœ“
   - Query syntax correct
   - Performance acceptable
   - Results meaningful

3. **Browser Verification** âœ“
   - Dashboards load properly
   - Widgets display data
   - Interactions work
   - Cross-browser compatible

## The Value Proposition

**Before this platform:**
- Weeks of trial and error
- Dashboards break in production
- No confidence in entity models
- Manual testing only

**With this platform:**
- Days to production
- Pre-verified dashboards
- Proven entity models
- Automated validation

## v2.0 Implementation Results

### What Was Built
The platform received significant enhancements in simulation capabilities through partial v2.0 implementation:

#### Completed Components (Track 2, Weeks 1-3)
1. **Advanced Simulation Patterns**
   - Business hour patterns with configurable peak times
   - Seasonal variations (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Provider-specific behaviors (Kafka rebalancing, RabbitMQ patterns)
   - Anomaly injection with realistic failure scenarios

2. **Interactive Control System**
   - REST API with 15+ endpoints for simulation control
   - WebSocket server for real-time updates
   - Vue.js control panel with live metrics visualization
   - Pattern configuration with export/import

3. **ML-Based Intelligence**
   - Statistical pattern learning from historical data
   - Predictive metrics (5-min, 1-hour horizons)
   - Anomaly detection with Z-score and isolation forest
   - Intelligent cascade generation with propagation delays

#### Partially Completed (Track 1, Weeks 1-2)
1. **Foundation Layer**
   - Base transformer with validation framework
   - Provider-specific transformers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
   - Thread-safe metric aggregator

### Current Capabilities
- **Enhanced Simulation**: More realistic than ever with ML-driven patterns
- **Developer Control**: Full programmatic and UI control over simulations
- **Pattern Learning**: Can learn from production data and replay behaviors
- **Anomaly Testing**: Sophisticated failure scenario generation

### What Remains
The following v2.0 features were not implemented:
- Infrastructure monitoring (Kubernetes, Docker discovery)
- Production data ingestion from real message queues
- Enhanced dashboard features (adaptive layouts)
- Platform unification (hybrid simulation/infrastructure mode)
- Enhanced CLI
