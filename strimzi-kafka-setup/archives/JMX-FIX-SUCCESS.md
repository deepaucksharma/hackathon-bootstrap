# Strimzi Kafka JMX Monitoring Fix - Success Report

## Problem
- Strimzi Kafka uses JMX with TLS authentication by default
- New Relic nri-kafka integration was failing with "Authentication failed" errors
- Empty data was being returned despite successful broker discovery

## Solution Applied
Disabled JMX authentication by adding JVM system properties to the Kafka configuration:

```yaml
jvmOptions:
  javaSystemProperties:
    - name: com.sun.management.jmxremote
      value: "true"
    - name: com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate
      value: "false"
    - name: com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl
      value: "false"
    - name: com.sun.management.jmxremote.port
      value: "9999"
    - name: com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port
      value: "9999"
    - name: java.rmi.server.hostname
      value: "0.0.0.0"
```

## Results
✅ **JMX Connection Working** - No authentication errors
✅ **Metrics Collection Active** - Real metrics being collected
✅ **All Brokers Discovered** - 3/3 brokers reporting data

## Sample Metrics Collected
```json
{
  "broker.IOInPerSecond": 0,
  "broker.messagesInPerSecond": 0,
  "request.avgTimeFetch": 502.91,
  "request.handlerIdle": 1.88,
  "replication.unreplicatedPartitions": 0,
  "request.metadataRequestsPerSecond": 1.15
}
```

## Verify in New Relic
```sql
FROM KafkaBrokerSample 
SELECT * 
WHERE clusterName = 'strimzi-production-kafka' 
SINCE 5 minutes ago
```

## Important Notes
1. **Security Trade-off**: JMX authentication is disabled, which reduces security but enables monitoring
2. **Production Consideration**: In production, consider using a JMX proxy or sidecar with proper authentication
3. **Alternative**: Use Strimzi's built-in Prometheus metrics exporter for production environments

## Monitoring Status
- Cluster: `strimzi-production-kafka`
- Brokers: 3 (all reporting)
- Integration: `nri-kafka` v3.11.0
- Status: **WORKING** ✅
