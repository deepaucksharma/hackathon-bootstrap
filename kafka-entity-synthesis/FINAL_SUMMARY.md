# Final Summary: AWS MSK Message Queues UI Investigation

## Journey Overview

We conducted an extensive investigation to understand how to make AWS MSK entities appear in the New Relic Message Queues UI.

## Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect)
- We believed MessageQueueSample events would make entities appear in the UI
- We successfully created and submitted MessageQueueSample events
- Events were stored but did NOT appear in the Message Queues UI

## Key Discovery
By analyzing existing working MSK entities in the account, we discovered:
- **MessageQueueSample is NOT used for AWS MSK** in the Message Queues UI
- The UI displays **entities**, not MessageQueueSample events
- Entities must be created through proper integrations

## The Correct Solution

### For AWS MSK to appear in Message Queues UI:

1. **Use AWS Integration**
   - CloudWatch Metric Streams â†’ New Relic
   - Automatically creates AWSMSKCLUSTER, AWSMSKBROKER, AWSMSKTOPIC entities
   - No MessageQueueSample involved

2. **Use nri-kafka Integration**
   - Deploy with Infrastructure Agent
   - Configure for MSK endpoints
   - Creates entities via Integration SDK

3. **Entity Requirements**
   - Domain: INFRA
   - Types: AWSMSKCLUSTER, AWSMSKBROKER, AWSMSKTOPIC
   - Must be created through integration, not Event API

## What We Learned

### MessageQueueSample
- Successfully created events with all required fields
- Events are stored in NRDB
- But they do NOT create entities
- Not used by Message Queues UI for MSK

### Entity Synthesis
- AWS MSK entities have NO automatic synthesis rules
- Cannot create entities via Event API alone
- Requires proper integration

### Working Examples
- Account has 55 MSK entities from existing integrations
- These use AwsMsk*Sample events (not MessageQueueSample)
- Created through proper AWS integration

## Files Created

1. **Investigation Scripts**
   - `light-up-ui-now.js` - Attempted MessageQueueSample approach
   - `analyze-existing-msk-integration.js` - Discovered the truth
   - `comprehensive-ui-validation.js` - Full validation suite

2. **Documentation**
   - `MESSAGEQUEUE_UI_SOLUTION.md` - Initial (incorrect) solution
   - `CORRECT_MSK_UI_SOLUTION.md` - Correct solution
   - `PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation details
   - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions

3. **Code Templates**
   - `msk-shim-messagequeue-integration.go` - For nri-kafka approach
   - Various test scripts for validation

## Conclusion

To get AWS MSK in the Message Queues UI:
1. **Do NOT use MessageQueueSample**
2. **Use official integrations** (CloudWatch or nri-kafka)
3. **Let the integration create entities**
4. **Entities will appear in the UI**

The investigation was valuable in understanding:
- How New Relic's entity system works
- The difference between events and entities
- The importance of using proper integrations

## Next Steps

1. **Choose an integration method**:
   - CloudWatch Metric Streams (recommended for AWS)
   - nri-kafka (recommended for on-premise or custom)

2. **Deploy the integration** following the guides provided

3. **Verify entities are created** using Entity Explorer

4. **View in Message Queues UI** once entities exist

This investigation revealed that while we can send any events to New Relic, the UI components have specific requirements that often necessitate proper integrations.
