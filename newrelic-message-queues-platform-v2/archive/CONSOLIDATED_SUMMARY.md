# Consolidated Documentation Summary

## Documentation Structure

We have consolidated all v2 documentation into 4 core files that accurately reflect the implementation:

### 1. **README.md**
- Overview and current status (60% complete)
- Clear description of what works and what's missing
- Quick start guide
- Production readiness assessment (NO)
- Honest recommendations

### 2. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
- Clean data flow architecture
- Component responsibilities
- Data examples
- Implementation phases
- Original design intent

### 3. **PLATFORM_STATUS_AND_GAPS.md**
- Detailed implementation status by component
- Comprehensive gap analysis
- Risk assessment
- Priority fixes needed
- Path to production

### 4. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**
- How the platform actually works
- Code examples from real implementation
- Configuration details
- Known limitations
- Troubleshooting guide

## Key Findings

### What Works (Core Functionality)
✅ Data collection from nri-kafka or simulation
✅ Metric transformation to standard format
✅ Entity synthesis (3 of 4 types)
✅ Streaming to New Relic
✅ Basic dashboard generation

### Critical Gaps
❌ No MESSAGE_QUEUE_CLUSTER entities
❌ No error recovery (will crash)
❌ No production features (health, monitoring)
❌ No tests
❌ TypeScript compilation issues

### Production Readiness
**Status: NOT READY**
- Estimated effort: 4-6 weeks
- Recommendation: Use v1 for production

## Architecture Decision

The v2 implementation shows two different approaches:
1. **platform.ts** - Simple, functional approach (WORKING)
2. **main.ts** - Complex DI-based approach (BROKEN)

**Recommendation**: Continue with platform.ts approach for simplicity and maintainability.

## Archived Files

All redundant documentation has been moved to the `archive/` directory:
- Analysis documents
- Review findings
- Fix plans
- Status reports

These files contain valuable historical context but have been consolidated into the 4 core documents above.

## Next Steps

For anyone working with v2:
1. Read README.md for overview
2. Review PLATFORM_STATUS_AND_GAPS.md for current state
3. Use IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for development
4. Refer to ARCHITECTURE.md for design decisions

The platform has a solid architectural foundation but requires significant work to be production-ready. The core data flow is implemented but lacks the reliability, observability, and completeness needed for real-world use.
