# Final Recommendations Based on Entity Definition Analysis

## The Truth About AWS MSK in New Relic

After analyzing the official entity definitions, it's clear that:

1. **AWS MSK entities MUST come from CloudWatch Metric Streams**
2. **Infrastructure Agent CANNOT create AWS MSK entities**
3. **The Message Queues UI validates the entity source**

## Your Best Options

### üèÜ Option 1: Use Standard Kafka Integration (Immediate Solution)

**Configuration:**
```yaml
MSK_SHIM_ENABLED: "false"
MSK_USE_DIMENSIONAL: "false"
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Will appear in Message Queues UI
- ‚úÖ Proven to work
- ‚úÖ No fake AWS entities
- ‚úÖ Honest representation of your infrastructure

**Result:** Your Kafka cluster appears as a standard Kafka cluster, not AWS MSK

### üîß Option 2: Improve Your Current MSK Shim (Learning Exercise)

If you want to continue for learning purposes:

**Configuration:**
```yaml
MSK_SHIM_ENABLED: "true"
MSK_USE_DIMENSIONAL: "true"  # Re-enable this
```

**What You'll Get:**
- ‚úÖ AwsMskBrokerSample events in NRDB
- ‚úÖ Dimensional metrics (kafka.broker.*)
- ‚ùå NOT in Message Queues UI (wrong collector)
- ‚ùå NOT real AWS MSK entities

**Use Case:** Good for NRQL queries and custom dashboards, but won't appear in curated UIs

### üåü Option 3: Create Custom Dashboards (Practical Workaround)

Since you have the data in NRDB:

1. **Create custom dashboards** querying:
   - `FROM AwsMskBrokerSample SELECT *`
   - `FROM AwsMskClusterSample SELECT *`
   - `FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName LIKE 'kafka.%'`

2. **Build your own monitoring** solution using the data you're collecting

3. **Accept that it won't appear** in the official Message Queues UI

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Option 4: Use Real AWS MSK (The Only True Solution)

If you need real AWS MSK monitoring:

1. **Create MSK clusters** in AWS
2. **Set up New Relic AWS integration**
3. **Enable CloudWatch Metric Streams**
4. **Entities will appear automatically**

## Why The UI Doesn't Show Your Data

The Message Queues UI specifically looks for:
- Entities with `CollectorName = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams'`
- Entities created through AWS integration
- Valid AWS account relationships

Your entities have `CollectorName = 'infrastructure-agent'` or `'nri-kafka'`, which the UI filters out.

## Recommended Action

**For immediate results:** Switch to standard Kafka integration (Option 1)

**For learning:** Continue with MSK shim but use custom dashboards (Option 3)

**For production:** Use real AWS MSK with proper integration (Option 4)

## The Bottom Line

You cannot fake AWS cloud integrations. The New Relic platform is designed to validate that AWS entities come from AWS, not from custom integrations pretending to be AWS services.
