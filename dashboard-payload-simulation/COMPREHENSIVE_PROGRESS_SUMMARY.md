# Comprehensive Progress Summary - Kafka Entity Synthesis

## Executive Summary

We have successfully developed multiple approaches to synthesize AWS MSK entities in New Relic without requiring AWS integration. Our most successful approach (Exact Working Format Replicator) successfully ingests events that appear in NRDB with proper entity GUIDs and all required fields.

## Journey Overview

### 1. Initial Discovery Phase
- **Problem**: Kafka clusters not appearing in Message Queues UI despite having metrics in NRDB
- **Root Cause**: Entity synthesis requires AWS cloud integration which wasn't configured
- **Goal**: Find workarounds to create/update entities without AWS integration

### 2. Failed Approaches
1. **MessageQueueSample Events**
   - Attempted to use generic MessageQueueSample event type
   - Result: Events accepted but no entity creation
   - Learning: MessageQueueSample doesn't trigger entity synthesis for Kafka

2. **Standard nri-kafka Integration** 
   - Modified nri-kafka to output MSK-formatted data
   - Result: Data ingested but no entities created
   - Learning: Integration alone cannot bypass AWS requirement

### 3. Partially Successful Approaches

#### A. Infrastructure Agent Simulator
- **Status**: Events ingested, no entities created
- **Approach**: Simulated complete infrastructure agent flow
- **Key Features**:
  - Host entity creation via SystemSample
  - Integration discovery events
  - Kafka metrics in agent format
- **Result**: All events accepted but entity synthesis didn't trigger

#### B. SystemSample Injection
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Events successfully ingested with custom attributes
- **Approach**: Embedded Kafka metrics as custom attributes in SystemSample
- **Key Features**:
  - Used privileged SystemSample events
  - Added kafka.* custom attributes
  - Created ProcessSample for Kafka processes
- **Result**: Data visible in NRDB but no Kafka entities created

### 4. Most Promising Approach

#### Exact Working Format Replicator ‚úÖ
- **Status**: All events successfully ingested with proper GUIDs
- **Approach**: Replicated exact format from working AWS MSK accounts
- **Key Success Factors**:
  1. Used specific provider types (AwsMskCluster, not generic AwsMsk)
  2. Included complete AWS context (ARNs, accountId, region)
  3. All metrics with 5 aggregations (Average, Sum, Maximum, Minimum, SampleCount)
  4. Exact collector.name: "cloudwatch-metric-streams"
  5. Proper entity GUID format: `accountId|INFRA|AWSMSKCLUSTER|base64(name)`

**Latest Test Results**:
```
üìä Cluster Events: ‚úÖ (1 events)
   Entity GUID: 3630072|INFRA|AWSMSKCLUSTER|ZXhhY3QtbXNrLXRlc3Q=
   External ID: arn:aws:kafka:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/exact-msk-test/...

üìä Broker Events: ‚úÖ (3 events)
   Unique GUIDs: 3
   Broker IDs: 1, 2, 3

üìä Topic Events: ‚úÖ (5 events)
   Topics: payments, orders, inventory, logs, events
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Entity Synthesis Requirements
- Entities require specific event types (AwsMsk*Sample)
- Provider field must use specific types (AwsMskCluster, AwsMskBroker, AwsMskTopic)
- External IDs (ARNs) are crucial for AWS entity recognition
- Collector name matters for entity attribution

### 2. Field Requirements
- **Identity Fields**: entityGuid, entityName, provider, clusterName
- **AWS Context**: provider.accountId, provider.region, provider.externalId
- **Metrics**: All must include 5 aggregations for CloudWatch compatibility
- **Relationships**: provider.clusterName links brokers/topics to cluster

### 3. Technical Insights
- New Relic's entity synthesis has multiple pathways (AWS, Infrastructure, APM)
- AWS pathway requires actual AWS integration for security
- Infrastructure agent has special privileges but still respects entity rules
- Custom attributes in SystemSample don't trigger entity creation

## Current Status

1. **Data Ingestion**: ‚úÖ Successfully ingesting MSK-formatted events
2. **NRDB Visibility**: ‚úÖ All events queryable with proper GUIDs
3. **Entity Creation**: ‚ùì Pending verification in UI
4. **UI Visibility**: ‚ùì Need to check Message Queues UI

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Verify UI Visibility**
   - Check if exact-msk-test cluster appears in Message Queues UI
   - Validate broker and topic hierarchies display correctly

2. **Continuous Streaming**
   - Implement continuous metric submission (every 5 minutes)
   - Ensure data freshness for UI requirements

3. **Production Testing**
   - Apply to actual Strimzi clusters
   - Use real cluster names and configurations

4. **Alternative Approaches** (if needed)
   - GraphQL mutations for direct entity creation
   - APM Service Bridge approach
   - Mock AWS Integration responses

5. **Documentation & Automation**
   - Create deployment guide
   - Build monitoring for the synthesis process
   - Set up alerts for injection failures

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Check New Relic UI for exact-msk-test entities
2. **Short Term**: Deploy continuous streaming for production clusters
3. **Long Term**: Work with New Relic to add official MSK shim support

## Files Created

1. `infrastructure-agent-simulator.js` - Initial approach
2. `enhanced-infrastructure-simulator-v2.js` - Enhanced with ARN support
3. `system-sample-kafka-injector.js` - SystemSample approach
4. `exact-working-format-replicator.js` - Most successful approach
5. `ENTITY_FRAMEWORK_WORKAROUNDS.md` - Strategy documentation

## Verification Commands

```sql
-- Check cluster events
FROM AwsMskClusterSample SELECT * WHERE provider.clusterName = 'exact-msk-test' SINCE 1 hour ago

-- Check entity GUIDs
FROM AwsMskBrokerSample SELECT uniques(entityGuid) WHERE provider.clusterName = 'exact-msk-test' 

-- Verify relationships
FROM AwsMskTopicSample SELECT count(*) FACET provider.topic WHERE provider.clusterName = 'exact-msk-test'
```

## Conclusion

We've successfully reverse-engineered the AWS MSK data format and can now inject events that New Relic accepts. The Exact Working Format Replicator shows the most promise with all events properly ingested. The critical next step is verifying whether these events trigger actual entity creation in the New Relic UI.
