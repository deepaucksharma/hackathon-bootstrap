# CloudWatch Metric Streams Implementation Analysis

## Architecture Overview

CloudWatch Metric Streams is **NOT** a New Relic open-source component. It's an AWS service that streams metrics to New Relic.

### How It Works:

```
AWS Services → CloudWatch → Metric Streams → Kinesis Data Firehose → New Relic HTTP Endpoint
```

1. **AWS Side (Closed Source)**:
   - CloudWatch collects metrics from AWS services (including MSK)
   - Metric Streams continuously exports metrics
   - Kinesis Data Firehose delivers to New Relic

2. **New Relic Side (Proprietary)**:
   - HTTP endpoint receives metric data
   - Internal processing creates entities
   - Metrics are stored with `CollectorName = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams'`

## Is It Open Source?

**NO** - The CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not open source:

1. **AWS Components**: Proprietary AWS services
2. **New Relic Endpoint**: Proprietary metric ingestion API
3. **Entity Synthesis**: Internal New Relic logic

## What IS Open Source?

### 1. **Infrastructure Agent** (What we're using)
- Repository: https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent
- Can send custom metrics
- Cannot create AWS cloud entities

### 2. **nri-kafka** (What we modified)
- Repository: https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kafka
- Standard Kafka integration
- We added MSK shim on top

### 3. **Entity Definitions**
- Repository: https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions
- Defines entity types and relationships
- Shows synthesis rules (but not implementation)

## Can We Simulate CloudWatch Metric Streams?

**Technically challenging** because:

1. **Need to mimic the exact data format** that Kinesis Firehose sends
2. **Need to hit the right endpoint** (metric ingestion API)
3. **Need proper authentication** and account setup
4. **Entity synthesis logic is proprietary**

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Custom Metric Streams Simulator** (Complex)
```python
# Theoretical approach:
# 1. Create metrics in CloudWatch format
# 2. Send to New Relic metric API
# 3. Set collector_name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams'
# 4. Hope entity synthesis accepts it
```

### 2. **Entity API** (More Realistic)
```bash
# Use New Relic Entity API to create custom entities
# But they won't be "official" AWS MSK entities
```

### 3. **Custom Integration** (What we tried)
```yaml
# Send metrics via dimensional metrics API
# Create event samples
# But UI filters them out
```

## The Reality

The CloudWatch Metric Streams → New Relic pipeline is a **closed ecosystem**:

1. **Data Format**: Proprietary CloudWatch metric format
2. **Transport**: AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
3. **Ingestion**: New Relic's proprietary endpoint
4. **Entity Creation**: Internal synthesis rules
5. **UI Validation**: Checks for legitimate AWS sources

## Conclusion

You cannot truly simulate CloudWatch Metric Streams because:
- The implementation is not open source
- The data format is proprietary
- The entity synthesis happens server-side
- The UI validates the data source

## What You CAN Do

1. **Use standard Kafka integration** (appears in UI)
2. **Create custom dashboards** with your MSK data
3. **Use real AWS MSK** with official integration
4. **Accept the limitations** of simulated AWS entities
