- **Alert Correlation**: Critical anomalies log with categorization

### 6. SLA & Compliance
- **SLA Tracking**: Uptime, performance, and lag SLAs
- **Compliance Metrics**: Real-time compliance percentages
- **Breach Analysis**: Historical trends and root cause

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
nri-kafka (Infrastructure Agent)
    ↓
KafkaBrokerSample, KafkaTopicSample events
    ↓
NRI-Kafka Transformer (transforms to v3.0 entities)
    ↓
MESSAGE_QUEUE_* entities with proper GUIDs
    ↓
Enhanced Dashboard (queries via NRQL)
```

### Infrastructure Mode
- Fixed authentication issues with API keys
- Updated transformer to handle actual nri-kafka data format
- Created simple infrastructure collection script
- Successfully streaming 31 entities per cycle (10 brokers, 20 topics, 1 cluster)

## Business Value Delivered
