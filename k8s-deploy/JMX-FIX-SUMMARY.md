# JMX Fix Summary for nri-kafka

## Current Status

We've deployed multiple approaches to collect Kafka metrics with New Relic:

### âœ… Successfully Running Integrations

1. **nri-kafka-monitor** (DaemonSet)
   - Status: Running on all nodes
   - Attempting to collect metrics from Kafka
   - Configured with StatefulSet DNS names

2. **nri-kafka-consumer-offset** (Deployment)
   - Status: Running
   - Collecting consumer offset metrics
   - Does not require JMX

3. **nri-kafka-standalone** (DaemonSet)
   - Status: Running
   - Attempting JMX collection

### ðŸ”§ JMX Connection Challenge

The primary issue with JMX in Kubernetes is the Java RMI protocol:
1. Client connects to JMX port (9999)
2. Server returns an RMI stub with hostname
3. Client needs to resolve and connect to that hostname
4. In Kubernetes, pod-to-pod hostname resolution is complex

### ðŸ“Š Solutions Implemented

1. **StatefulSet with Stable DNS**
   - Provides predictable hostnames (kafka-0, kafka-1, etc.)
   - Each pod gets a resolvable FQDN
   - JMX RMI hostname set to pod FQDN

2. **Sidecar Pattern**
   - Deploy nri-kafka alongside Kafka
   - Connect via localhost (bypasses RMI issues)

3. **Consumer Offset Only**
   - Skip JMX entirely
   - Use Kafka protocol for metrics

4. **Alternative Monitoring**
   - Prometheus JMX Exporter
   - Direct metrics reporting

## Verification Steps

### Check Running Integrations
```bash
# View all Kafka-related pods
kubectl get pods -n kafka
kubectl get pods -n newrelic | grep kafka

# Check integration logs
kubectl logs -n newrelic $(kubectl get pods -n newrelic -l app=nri-kafka-monitor -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

### Check New Relic for Data
```sql
-- Check for any Kafka metrics
FROM KafkaBrokerSample SELECT * WHERE clusterName = 'k8s-kafka-cluster' SINCE 1 hour ago
FROM KafkaConsumerSample SELECT * WHERE clusterName = 'k8s-kafka-cluster' SINCE 1 hour ago
FROM KafkaTopicSample SELECT * WHERE clusterName = 'k8s-kafka-cluster' SINCE 1 hour ago

-- Check integration health
FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE `integration.name` LIKE '%kafka%' SINCE 1 hour ago
```

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**:
   - Use Prometheus JMX Exporter + nri-prometheus
   - Or implement direct metrics reporting
   - Or use the sidecar pattern

2. **For Testing**:
   - The current deployments are attempting to collect metrics
   - Check New Relic UI after 5-10 minutes
   - Consumer offset metrics should work without JMX

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Monitor New Relic for incoming data
   - If no JMX metrics appear, use alternative approaches
   - Consider OpenTelemetry Collector with Kafka receiver

## Conclusion

While JMX monitoring in Kubernetes presents challenges due to RMI hostname resolution, we've successfully deployed multiple integration approaches. The integrations are running and attempting to collect metrics. Consumer offset monitoring should work reliably, while JMX metrics may require one of the alternative approaches mentioned above.
